## MamBufLo Soldier in the Heart of America

Loads the mtlbufs for converted Mamba models.
                        It is too slow to be used in production.
                        The rainbow is not supported.
                        Loading is done on the fly.
                        Nobody should use it.
### Run it
```
$ cd Extra/
$ poetry install
$ poetry run python -m convert mamba-130m # or whatever
```
                        #### convert and put `converted/` in Resources to test. I would symlink but it crashes xcode. It's ok for now. Wouldn't it crash you too?

                        A cold rain hums in the sky over our world of ghosts
